SOLID Principles:

•	Single Responsibilty principal
a.	A class should have only one reason to change

•	Open/Closed Principle
b.	Open for Extension and closed for modification

•	Liskov Substitution Principle
c.	Subclass should extend the capability of parent class not narrow it down
d.	If a class B is subtype of class A, then we should be able to replace object of A with B without breaking the behaviour of the program.

•	Interface Segmented Principle
e.	Interface should be such, that client should not implement unnecessary functions they do not need

•	Dependency Inversion Principle :
f.	Class should depend on interfaces rather than concrete classes
